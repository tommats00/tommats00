<h1 align="center">Hello there! I'm Tom Gibbens-Matsuyamaüëã</h1>

I am currently a graduate student in UC Santa Barbara's [Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS)](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) program. I am interested in marine ecology and fisheries management and aim to use the skills I gain in this program to promote sustainable practices and develop innovative solutions in these fields. Outside of school, I enjoy all the activities that activities that Southern California has to offer, such as hiking, surfing, fishing, and being in the sun!

## What am I up to?

I am currently in the fall quarter at UCSB taking R and Python coding classes. These classes include EDS223-GeoSpatial Analysis, EDS222-Stats for EDS, EDS220-Environmental Data, EDS 242-Ethics Bias for EDS, and EDS296-Data science tools for building a professional online portfolio (thanks [Sam!](https://samanthacsik.github.io/). At the same time, I am TAing for a life science statistics course [(PSTAT5LS)](https://catalog.ucsb.edu/courses/PSTAT%205LS). It is my first time teaching students, so it was a little nerve racking in the beginning, but I have enjoyed my time so far. Teaching is not only fun, but it also has further developed my understanding of the fundamentals of statistics.

### A little more about me

I am a Southern California local, as I was born and raised in Ventura. Growing up I had many little boys' dream of becoming a professional baseball player, but was later hit with the realization of the difficulty to do so! Luckily, I had a love for the ocean, which led me to studying marine biology at the [University of Hawai ªi at MƒÅnoa](https://manoa.hawaii.edu/). I was introduced to the power of programming languages during my time there and wanted to explore more. Fortunately, this led me to discover the newly founded [MEDS](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) program at UCSB. I am thrilled to be a part of the 4th cohort this program has to offer. I love the relationships I have forged and can't wait for what this school year has to offer!
