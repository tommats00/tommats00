<h1 align="center">Hello there! I'm Tom Gibbens-MatsuyamaðŸ‘‹</h1>

I'm a Southern California native, born and raised in Ventura. I recently earned my Master of Environmental Data Science from [UC Santa Barbara's Bren School](https://bren.ucsb.edu/), where I gained hands-on experience in data wrangling, visualization, dashboard development, statistical analysis, and more. Iâ€™ve worked with multiple programming languages, including R, Python, and SQL, and I'm currently interested in expanding my skills in tools like ArcGIS and Power BI. For my master's capstone project, I collaborated with the [California Water Data Consortium](https://cawaterdata.org/) to visualize water shortage data across urban water utilities throughout California. Iâ€™ll continue working in this sector as a GIS Intern with the [Santa Margarita Water District](https://www.smwd.com/) in Orange County starting in August.

Outside of school and work, I enjoy taking advantage of everything Southern California has to offer, including hiking, camping, and spending time at the beach. I like to stay active through pickleball, golf, and working out. 

Feel free to check out my repositories and my other sources!
