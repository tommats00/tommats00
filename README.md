<h1 align="center">Hello there! I'm Tom Gibbens-MatsuyamaðŸ‘‹</h1>
I am currently a graduate student in UC Santa Barbara's [Master of Environmental Data Science (MEDS)](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science) program. I am interested in marine ecology and fisheries management and aim to use the skills I gain in this program to promote sustainable practices and develop innovative solutions in these fields. Outside of school, I enjoy all the activities that activities that Southern California has to offer, such as hiking, surfing, fishing, and being in the sun!
